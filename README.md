## PJ Tab Age Grouper 
### Automatically organize your browser tabs based on how long they've been inactive.

### How it works:
  - Tabs you haven't visited in a while get grouped into "Stale" (yellow)
  - Tabs idle even longer move to "Dead" (red)
  - When you revisit a tab, it's automatically ungrouped
  - Groups stay on the left side of your tab bar, keeping active tabs accessible
### Settings:
  - Adjustable thresholds from 30 seconds to 2 weeks
  - Click the time values to type exact durations (e.g. "5m", "2h", "1d")
  - Settings sync across your Chrome browsers

No tracking. No external connections. Just tab organization.
